# Palm Engine — Project Status

**Current Version:** `0.14.9` (shipping)  
**Last Updated:** June 26, 2026  
**Maturity:** Wizard Experience shipped · **0.14 MCP** operator adapter shipped for coding agents.

## Quick Overview

Palm is a lightweight, Python-first orchestration engine built on a clean **Behavior Tree** foundation. It excels at complex multi-step workflows, rich interactive wizards, compositional sub-flow orchestration, and transactional processes with durable state and human-in-the-loop participation.

**Distribution name:** `palmengine` (PyPI)  
**Import name:** `palm`  
**Recommended entrypoint:** `ApplicationHost` via `create_cli_host()` for CLI, or `ApplicationHost(profile=HostProfile.all_in_one())` for library use

## Architecture Snapshot

Palm follows a **layered, registry-driven** model with a strictly pure core:

- `palm/core/` — Pure foundational engines (Behavior Tree, Orchestration, Context, Storage, Resource, Event, Auth, Transform). **Zero external Palm imports allowed.**
- `palm/common/` — Rich shared coordination layer (executions, plans, hooks, persistence, CQRS, compensation, transforms, runtime infrastructure).
- `palm/app/` — Application orchestration. `ApplicationHost` is the primary recommended orchestrator; `PalmApp` is infrastructure.
- `palm/patterns/`, `palm/providers/`, `palm/storages/` — Extensible plugin-style apps (`PatternApp` / `ProviderApp` + `bindings/`/`flow/` — see [docs/PATTERN-APPS.md](docs/PATTERN-APPS.md) and [docs/PROVIDER-APPS.md](docs/PROVIDER-APPS.md)).
- `palm/runtimes/` — Thin surfaces over the common runtime layer.

See [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md) and [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) for full details and rules.

## Key Capabilities (Mature)

- Behavior Tree execution engine
- **Resource system (0.12)** — `ResourceDefinition`, `ResourceEngine`, `ResourceLeaf`, `ResourceCatalog`, `palm` provider
- Powerful Wizard pattern (validation, collection, transform, **resource** steps, parallel branches, backtracking, summary + commit)
- **Wizard REST + Explorer (0.13)** — `/v1/wizards`, HTMX workspace, collection editor
- 22 built-in transform rules + extensible `TransformEngine` (`enrich_resource` with `resource_ref`)
- Layered state schemas + scoped execution state
- Durable process instances with resume across restarts
- CQRS (Command + Query buses + projections including `resource_invocations`)
- Reliability primitives: Transactional outbox, Compensation handlers (resource undo), Webhook dispatch support
- Composable host roles (`ApplicationHost` + `HostProfile`)
- Rich CLI + REPL with live dashboard (`palm status`) and `palm resource *` commands
- Multiple runtimes (Embedded, Daemon, Server, CLI)
- **Palm Explorer** — SSR hub at `/explorer` (flows, jobs, instances, wizard workspace, **resources**); `GET /` redirects here
- **MCP operator adapter (0.14)** — `palm-mcp` stdio + native HTTP `/mcp`; 26 tools, 4 prompts, 10 resources for coding agents; [docs/MCP.md](docs/MCP.md)

## Areas Under Active Improvement
- WebSocket runtime surface for live wizard/job streaming
- Explorer inline validation for collection field errors
- Saga-style compensation patterns beyond single-resource undo
- KernelLeaf / GPU execution research (non-goal for 0.13)

## Known Limitations & Technical Debt

- Documentation consistency enforced via `just docs-check` and `just guard-common` (wired into `just check` / `just release-prep`)
- Field-phase cancel in Explorer may not always map to wizard cancel (use REST/CLI for edge cases)
- Standalone `ServerRuntime` may return empty resource invocation rows when projections aren't wired

## Priorities & Next Steps

2. Version bump + CHANGELOG for 0.14 MCP when ready
3. WebSocket surface for live wizard prompts
4. Explorer flow dry-run and definition preview
